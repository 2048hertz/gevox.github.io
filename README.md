*GEVOX WEBSITE*

how this works: 
basically its a easy method where you make the website in google sites and you export it through drive and takeout then use those files with github pages and you've got an easily built website with no google traces, however it doesn't index in some cases or almost all because there is a no-index tag most of the time, if you are lucky then it won't be there.
